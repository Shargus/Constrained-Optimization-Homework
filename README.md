# Constrained-Optimization-Homework
Constrained optimization homework for the Numerical Optimization exam.

Text of the problem: consider the following constrained optimization problem, with a hyper-ellipsoid objective function:
```math
f(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2, \qquad âˆ’5.12 \leq x_i \leq 5.12
```
Use your own implementation of the projected gradient method to solve the problem with $n = 10^d$ and $d = 3, 4, 5$, both using exact derivatives and finite differences to approximate the gradient. Compare the behavior of the two implementations, using the following values for the increment $h$:
```math
h = 10^{-k}\parallel\hat{\mathbf{x}}\parallel, \qquad k = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12
```
where $\hat{\mathbf{x}}$ is the point at which the derivatives have to be approximated.
